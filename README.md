# A Job Search Environment

Gathers information about employment opportunities using multiple sources. [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) are only a couple of the many awesome search engines available. This project offers three major additions:

1. Combines results from multiple web pages
2. Searches for skills required by job position
3. Compares companies by job positions available


# Job Search Questions

1. What is the tech company's mission statement?
2. How many job oppenings does a company currently have?
3. Do companies have job listings for the same job posted in different sites?
4. What job positions does a company seek the most?
5. What skill set, i.e. code languages, does a certain job position generaly require?


# Dependencies

[BeautifulSoup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeautifulSoup). With beautifulsoup, 
gathering and parsing of website continent is extremely well structured. 
However, setting it up correctly everytime when looking for employment is a 
painful process that involves many steps. To make life easier, I've packaged
these processes up in this **job-search-web-scraper** project.

# Status

Alpha. Please share any thoughts and submit pull requests!

# Limitations and known issues

Time permitting, I'll be looking into creating a dataframe to manipulate all the information. 

# Contributing
