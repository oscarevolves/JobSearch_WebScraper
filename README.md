# Job Search Questions

1. What is the tech company's main intention?
2. How many job oppenings do tech companies currently have?
3. Do tech companies have job listings for the same job posted in different sites?
4. What job positions does a tech company require the most?
5. What skill set, i.e. code languages, does a certain job position generaly require?

# A Job Search Environment

Gathers information about employment opportunities using multiple sources. [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) are only a couple of the many awesome search engines available. This project offers three major additions:

1. Combines results from multiple web pages
2. Searches for skills required by job position
3. Compares companies by job positions available

[BeautifulSoup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeautifulSoup). With beautifulsoup, 
gathering and parsing of website continent is extremely well structured. 
However, setting it up correctly everytime when looking for employment is a 
painful process that involves many steps. To make life easier, I've packaged
these processes up in this **job-search-web-scraper** project.

# Status

Alpha. Please share any thoughts and submit pull requests!

# Limitations and known issues

Time permitting, I'll be looking into creating a dataframe to manipulate all the information. 

# Contributing

Contributions are very welcome via pull request. This project is in a very early
alpha stage and it needs a lot of work. Take a look at the 
[issues](https://github.com/oscarevolves/jobsearch-webscraper/issues) for known bugs and
enhancements, especially the ones marked with the 
[help wanted](https://github.com/oscarevolves/jobsearch-webscraper/labels/help%20wanted)
